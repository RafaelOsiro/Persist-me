# Persist-me
We have to create an interactive scene in a Swift Playgrounds app project that can be experienced within three minutes. Be creative. If you need inspiration, use the provided templates for a head start on more advanced creations. Make them your own by adding graphics, audio, and more.

And so Persist-me was born.
The objective of the game is the player persist and have patience. As a reward, he will unlock some assets.
The game will tell a storytelling about one of my journey.

My app project was inspired in a game called [Just Button](https://apps.apple.com/br/app/just-button/id1580675293).
